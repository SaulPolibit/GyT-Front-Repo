            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">POLIBIT is a Mexican company that offers advisory and consulting services on all types of topics related to emerging information technologies. In particular, POLIBIT provides real estate developers (the &quot;Developers&quot;) with technological tools and the use of the Software (as defined later) so that these Developers can promote their projects and sell tokens created using the technology known as blockchain (the &quot;Tokens&quot;) to their clients. The above, with the understanding that POLIBIT only provides technological infrastructure for management and operation, but in no way will it participate in the sale of Tokens, the follow-up services provided by the Developers, or the promotion of real estate projects.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">POLIBIT will grant Users access through the Portal to information about projects managed by the Developer(s) (the &quot;Marketplace&quot;), as applicable (the &quot;POLIBIT Service&quot;), where each Developer will publish various tokenized real estate projects for sale or closed. The tokenized real estate projects for sale refer to the projects on which the developer is selling Tokens. Closed tokenized real estate projects refer to the projects for which the developer has already completed the sale of the Tokens assigned to that project. For such purposes, every Developer managing a Marketplace has entered into a service provision contract through which POLIBIT grants them a license to use the Software. By virtue of the above, POLIBIT will provide the respective Developer with authorization for access and use of the Software (as defined later), with the following services and components: i) usage licenses; ii) hosting; iii) installation and configuration; iv) training; v) maintenance; and vi) technical support. The &quot;Software&quot; refers to the set of programs, applications, operating systems, databases, user interfaces, codes, algorithms, data, documentation, and other computer components, whether in the form of source code or object code, that POLIBIT makes available to the Developer for use as an online service accessible via the Internet in Software as a Service mode.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">In accordance with these Terms and Conditions, POLIBIT provides the technological platform for the management of digital Tokens, supplies the technological infrastructure to Developers under a &quot;white label&quot; scheme so that they can manage their own projects.
</p>

</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEVELOPERS
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">The User acknowledges and accepts that POLIBIT provides the Software that facilitates the use of blockchain-based tokenization technology to support the Developer&apos;s activities. However, POLIBIT is not, nor will it be interpreted as, a financial intermediary, fund collector, or entity authorized to carry out regulated activities under the Credit Institutions Law or any other applicable financial regulations in Mexico.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">In such a manner, the Developer is solely responsible for all activities related to the sale of Tokens associated with tokenized real estate projects, which includes, but is not limited to, the following:
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Promotion and Advertising: the Developer will manage all communications, announcements, and marketing materials related to the sale of the Tokens, ensuring that such materials do not directly or indirectly involve POLIBIT in regulated activities. The Developer must avoid any statement that could be interpreted as a public offering of securities or mass fundraising.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Management of the Relationship with Users/Acquirers: the Developer will independently manage any interaction with Users/Acquirers, including: the search, evaluation, and selection of potential clients; and the obtaining of the necessary consents and documentation to formalize the relationship with Users/Acquirers. The Developer must enter into the corresponding contract with each User.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Administration and Control of Resources: the Developer is responsible for receiving, safeguarding, and managing any resources obtained through the sale of Tokens, ensuring that the funds are not transferred or managed through the POLIBIT infrastructure to avoid unauthorized fundraising.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Regulatory Compliance: the Developer will be responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations of the corresponding financial system.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">The above is understood with the notion that POLIBIT will only act as a host for the tokenization technology, regarding the rights recorded in the Token in relation to the Real Estate Developer for the purpose of any act aimed at safeguarding rights. The User is informed that POLIBIT will use the relevant systems to track the location of the Tokens, as well as to register who holds them as the owner, in order to comply with regulatory requirements in real estate matters related to AML/KYC. Therefore, in the event that a Token is lost, POLIBIT will have the authority to locate it, burn it, and issue a new one to assign to the User who is the Token owner.  In that sense, in case of loss, the User must immediately notify POLIBIT to take the necessary actions. The loss of Tokens will be the sole responsibility of the User, and the User assumes the loss of the item in case POLIBIT is unable to restore it. It is brought to your attention that POLIBIT does not act as a financial advisor; therefore, any contracts are made by the User under their exclusive responsibility.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Additionally, and in accordance with the contract entered into between the User and the Developer at the time of the acquisition of a Token (the &quot;Developer Contract&quot;), the following are the Developer&apos;s responsibilities:
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">The payment of the Benefits linked to the Tokens that the Developer sells to the Users.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Facilitate relevant information about the progress of the respective real estate project, as well as the key payment dates for the Benefits linked to the sale of the Tokens;
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Manage the resources obtained from the sale of the Tokens, which will never and under no circumstances be deposited into any bank account of POLIBIT or under its control or possession.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Ensure that each User provides the corresponding information, whether it be a wallet or a bank account, where they can receive the benefits linked to the acquired Tokens, which will at no time be the responsibility of POLIBIT;
For clarity purposes, POLIBIT will be responsible solely for: (a) providing and enabling the use of its technological platform (www.polibit.io) as a Marketplace under white label usage so that the developer can manage it directly, without POLIBIT being responsible for such commercialization, for which timely collaboration from the Developer will be necessary by providing relevant project information and materials, and (b) simplifying the continuous management of the digital asset by automating tasks such as regulatory compliance and other operations that contribute to significant savings in time and operational resources for the Developer.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the Portal, as well as any technology that may be used by POLIBIT for the provision of the POLIBIT Service (the &quot;Platform&quot;), and access to it constitutes a binding contract (an &quot;Agreement&quot;) between POLIBIT and the User. The Privacy Notice is mandatory and binding for all Users. In case the User does not agree with the Privacy Notice, in whole or in part, they must refrain from using, operating, visiting the Portal, the Platform, and/or using the POLIBIT Service.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">By using the Portal, the Platform, and/or inducing their use electronically or through other means, the User indicates acceptance of the Agreement and acknowledges and agrees that: (i) POLIBIT is exempt from any responsibility, loss, damage, or risk resulting directly or indirectly from the use of the Portal, the Platform, or the POLIBIT Service; (ii) the use of the Portal and the Platform is subject to the terms of the Privacy Notice, as it may be modified from time to time; and (iii) the User will only use the materials contained in the Portal and the Platform for personal, non-commercial, and informational purposes, and will not modify any of the materials contained therein.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">UNREGISTERED USERS</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Unregistered Users will not have the right to browse the Portal. Only registered Users will have access to the POLIBIT Service, and all the content offered on the Portal, for which they must create a user account and enter the registration information.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">20. MODULAR APPLICATION OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">These Terms and Conditions have been designed with a modular structure to allow for their progressive and general application to the various services offered by POLIBIT, whether jointly or independently. Accordingly, the Terms and Conditions shall apply, as relevant, to each service offered by POLIBIT—including but not limited to its tokenization technology infrastructure, the KYC/AML compliance module, and any future services—to the extent that such terms are not incompatible with the specific nature of the service in question.
Each new service may incorporate a specific module or section within these Terms and Conditions, setting forth the particular provisions applicable to such service. In the event of any conflict between the general provisions of these Terms and Conditions and those of a specific service module, the provisions of the specific module shall prevail. 
This structure enables POLIBIT to expand and diversify its service offerings in a scalable manner while maintaining legal consistency and continuity for its Users, without the need to redesign or renegotiate the entire Terms and Conditions for each newly added service.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">21. ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE SERVICES (KYC/AML)</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">

Without prejudice to the provisions of the previous sections, and as part of the strategic evolution and diversification of its technological services, POLIBIT may offer its Users, whether Developers or authorized third parties, access to a specialized module of regulatory compliance technological services, focused on Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) prevention, through the use of its infrastructure under the Software as a Service (SaaS) model.

This compliance module has the sole purpose of providing technological tools that facilitate the automation, systematization, and monitoring of identity validation and financial integrity processes, without implying, under any circumstances, that POLIBIT engages in verification, analysis, diagnosis, legal validation, or regulatory review of compliance performed by Users, nor that POLIBIT guarantees the suitability, sufficiency, veracity, or completeness of the information collected or processed through this module.

In non-exhaustive but not limiting terms, these services may include:
a) The automation of the process of capturing and verifying personal data and official documents, in order to facilitate the filling out of forms and collect the necessary information to comply with Users&apos; internal policies regarding KYC/AML;
b) The integration of national and international verification lists including sanction lists, lists of politically exposed persons (PEPs), and watch lists through third-party providers, whose availability or validity is beyond POLIBIT&apos;s control;
c) The generation of user-configurable workflows to validate, reject, or request additional information according to their own risk criteria and compliance policy;
d) The enabling of a control panel for the exclusive use of the User, through which their compliance teams and advisors can consult the progress of the process and make follow-up or escalation decisions;
e) The optional synchronization of the module with User systems such as CRM Dynamics, SNAP Compliance, or other internal management systems, under the exclusive responsibility of the User regarding such interoperability.

These services are provided exclusively as a technological tool for operational support, without POLIBIT having any control, access, or responsibility over the decisions made by the User as a result of using these services. Consequently, the contracting of this module will be governed by the specific terms of license, support, usage limitations, and technological restrictions that POLIBIT establishes with each User, including clauses of non-responsibility for misuse, improper use, omissions in configuration, defective integrations, and other assumptions arising from the operation.

Likewise, these Terms and Conditions will apply complementarily, provided they do not conflict with the operational nature of the SaaS model offered for these purposes.
The User expressly acknowledges that POLIBIT does not provide legal, tax, financial, or auditing consultancy services, and that it assumes no responsibility for the effective compliance with regulatory obligations by the User or the legality of the procedures implemented by the latter. The User will be solely responsible for verifying that the use of the compliance module is aligned with the laws, regulations, and best practices applicable in their jurisdiction, as well as for maintaining the supporting documentation and evidence of compliance in accordance with the requirements of the competent authorities.

Finally, the User agrees to keep POLIBIT, its employees, representatives, and affiliates, safe and sound from any claim, proceeding, fine, or sanction arising directly or indirectly from the use of the KYC/AML compliance module, committing to cover all legal and defense expenses necessary to protect POLIBIT&apos;s interests in case of a conflict arising from such use.
</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">22. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, HACKING AND EXTERNALSECURITY EVENTS</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">The User acknowledges and agrees that POLIBIT solely providestechnological infrastructure under a software-as-a-service (SaaS)model for the management of tokenized real estate projects and, whereapplicable, digital assets through the Software. At no time doesPOLIBIT engage in the direct administration of wallets, private keys,passwords, tokens, bank accounts, or any other instrument thatinvolves custody, safekeeping, or control over the funds or assets ofthe User, Developers, or third parties.
Accordingly,the User understands and accepts the following:

POLIBIT does not provide digital asset custody services, nor does it participate in the safekeeping, handling, security, or operational administration of wallets, private keys, passwords, or other mechanisms granting access to digital assets. The technological functionality that enables Users or Developers to create accounts or link wallets through the Software shall not be construed as any form of administration, possession, or operational control by POLIBIT.

POLIBIT shall not be liable for losses, thefts, unauthorized access, hacking, alterations, or manipulation of information, digital assets, or wallets that occur as a result of security vulnerabilities beyond its reasonable control. This includes, without limitation, cyberattacks on wallets, User errors, social engineering fraud, unauthorized access to the devices or networks of the User or third parties, or the misuse of credentials by employees, representatives, or contractors of the User or Developers.

POLIBIT implements security measures consistent with industry standards in order to protect the availability and functioning of its technological infrastructure. However, the User acknowledges that no system is entirely fail-proof and, therefore, assumes the inherent risks associated with the use of digital technologies, including blockchain-based technologies, such as those arising from external attacks that may directly or indirectly affect the digital assets managed by the User through the Software.

In the event that any third party or authority seeks to attribute liability to POLIBIT for security incidents, hacking, losses, or thefts connected to the User&apos;s wallets, digital assets, or transactions, the User undertakes to hold POLIBIT harmless and to indemnify it against any damages, penalties, fines, claims, expenses, legal fees, or obligations arising therefrom, except in cases where such events are directly attributable to willful misconduct or gross negligence by POLIBIT in the administration of its own technological infrastructure.

The User, on its own behalf and on behalf of its representatives, employees, contractors, successors, assigns, and any other person acting in its name or under its direction, irrevocably waives any action, claim, demand, or proceeding against POLIBIT, its partners, directors, employees, affiliates, or advisors, for damages, losses, or injuries of any kind resulting, directly or indirectly, from unauthorized access, hacking, security breaches, theft of private keys, implementation errors, or any similar event caused by third parties outside the control of POLIBIT, even if such incidents affect the User itself or third parties related thereto.
